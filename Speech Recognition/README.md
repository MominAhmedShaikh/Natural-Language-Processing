# Speech recognition
Speech recognition is the process of converting spoken language into written or machine-readable text. It is a type of technology that allows computers to interpret and transcribe spoken words and phrases into written language. This can be used to transcribe a person's voice into a document, to create a written record of a conversation, or to control a computer or other device using voice commands. There are many applications for speech recognition, including dictation software, voice-controlled virtual assistants, and voice-enabled search systems.

### Steps involved in the process of speech recognition:

- Audio capture: The first step in speech recognition is to capture the audio of a person speaking. This can be done using a microphone or other audio input device.

- Pre-processing: The captured audio is then pre-processed to remove any background noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This can involve filtering the audio to remove certain frequencies or using techniques such as noise reduction to reduce background noise.

- Feature extraction: In this step, the relevant features of the audio signal are extracted and transformed into a form that can be used by the speech recognition system. This typically involves converting the audio signal into a sequence of spectral frames or "features" that capture the important characteristics of the signal.

- Acoustic modeling: Acoustic modeling involves creating a statistical model of the sounds and patterns of the language being spoken. This model is used to recognize the words and phrases spoken in the audio.

- Language modeling: Language modeling involves creating a statistical model of the structure and rules of the language being spoken. This model is used to predict the most likely sequence of words based on the context of the words that have already been recognized.

- Decoding: In the decoding step, the speech recognition system combines the information from the acoustic and language models to generate a transcription of the spoken words.

- Post-processing: The final step in speech recognition is post-processing, which involves cleaning up the transcription and correcting any errors or omissions. This can involve techniques such as spelling correction, punctuation insertion, and grammar checking.


### Models to develope for speech recognition

There are many different models that can be used for speech recognition, including hidden Markov models (HMMs), deep neural networks (DNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Hidden Markov models (HMMs)
- HMMs are a type of probabilistic graphical model that are commonly used for speech recognition. They are based on the assumption that the audio signal can be modeled as a sequence of states, each of which generates an observation (such as a spectral frame). HMMs are trained using a large dataset of annotated audio samples and can be used to recognize speech by finding the most likely sequence of states given the observations.

Deep neural networks (DNNs)
- DNNs are a type of neural network that are composed of multiple hidden layers of artificial neurons. They have been shown to be effective at speech recognition tasks and are often used in combination with HMMs to improve performance.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
- RNNs are a type of neural network that are designed to process sequential data, such as audio signals. They can be trained to recognize patterns in the audio and generate transcriptions by processing the audio signal one frame at a time and using the output from one frame as input to the next.


### Challenges in speech recognition :

When we are dealing with speech recognition, we often come across various challenges. Few of them are listed below :


- Noise: At the time of giving input to the model it may happen there is some noise in our voice which will be difficult for our model to analyze.
- Echo: At the time of analyzing, it will convert all the sounds to wave. In this situation, it will be often difficult to analyze the waves.
- Similar sounds: Similar sounds in input sound can make it confusing.
- Machine error sound: This can create a problem in recognizing the voice.
- Accents: There are different accents in different regions and different languages being spoken in different regions, hence it will be difficult to analyze and recognize those accents.
- Disorganized speech: Some of the speech waves may be in disorganized.
