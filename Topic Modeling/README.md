# Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is a method for `automatically identifying the topics` that are discussed in a collection of documents. It works by `analyzing the words used` in the documents and `identifying groups of words` that `frequently` occur together, which are assumed to correspond to the main topics discussed in the documents. The resulting topics can be used to understand the main themes of the documents, to find relevant documents, or to summarize the content of the documents.

Using topic modeling, we could identify the main themes or topics discussed in the reviews, such as "quality," "price," "ease of use," and "customer service." we could then use these topics to understand what customers are generally saying about the product, or to identify areas where the product could be improved.
