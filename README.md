# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This Repository contains my personal notes on NLP collected from various sources

NLP is a field of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence that gives machine an ability to understand human language better and to assist in language related tasks.

NLP is divided into two categories:

- Natural Language Understanding (NLU) [[Follow Here]](https://github.com/MominAhmedShaikh/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Understanding)

- Natural Language Generation (NLG)


Data is broadly classified into `Structured` and `Unstructured`


| Structured | Unstructured   |
| :--------: | :------- | 
| ! | No predefined data model or organization |
| ! | Around ~80-90% of Data in world is Unstructured |
| ! | No Standard model and Schema |
| ! | No Specific defination on storing, accessing and pre processing |
| ! | Difficult to process |
| ! | Even though it is Unstructured but provides holistic view of business|
| ! | Better understanding of this will provide competitive advantage |
| ! | **Example:** Raw, non-textual and textual data and can be one of audio , video , photos etc. |
| ! | **Sources:** HTML(Web , Chat , Blog , Web pages) , Forms , Multimedia Content , E-mail , SMS content, Documents (Memos , research papers , articles), etc.|

### Challenges Posed due to lack of Structured
- Easy for Humans, Hard for Machines
- Highly redundent data
- Huge amount of data pre-processing is required
- High Dimentionality
- Large no. of features
- Abstract ideas hard to represent

### Application
- Search Engine
- Auto Complete feature
- Language Translation
- Customer Relationship management systems
- Email filtres
- Product suggestion analysis
- Fraud detection
- Social media analytics
- Chat bots
- Video Processing
- Voice Assistant
- Speech recognition  [[Follow Here]](https://github.com/MominAhmedShaikh/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Speech%20Recognition)
- Named Entity Recognition
- Topic Modeling [[Follow Here]](https://github.com/MominAhmedShaikh/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Topic%20Modeling)

### Types of Unstructured Data Analysis
- Text Analysis [[Follow Here](https://github.com/MominAhmedShaikh/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Text%20Classification)]
- Audio Analysis
- Image Analysis
- Video Analysis

#### Roles Offered After NLP
- Data Scientist (specialized in NLP)
- NLP engineer
- NLP researcher

### Libraries to perform NLP
- NLTK
- Spacy
- Genmim
- TextBlob
